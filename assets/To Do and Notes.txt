redstone!
snow
ice
gunpowder
-charred stone
worms lol
chorus (which teleports nearby elements)
skulk? which spreads when something dies



=== FEATURES ===

consistent drawing lines

a "shuffle all elements on the board lol" button

// DONE //               an undo button

remove the fill feature

make the plant element more plant-y

make wet sponge turn to water when lava'd


=== KNOWN ISSUES ===

// DONE // pressing a button while using the eyedropper tool is fucked up

Lava doesnt destroy sponges from the sides



=== NOTES ===
if you wanted to make a smart element you can make an object which can store info about each element at its x and y indexes

you could potentially remake the whole program and have it be smartDisplay() and copy() oriented.
idk how worth it this would be, it'd certainly be nice to be rid of all of the random functions, but idk if itd be optimized

ok what if you hid some random image in falling sand

how would one go about playing bad apple on falling sand

maybe make a chance of water just eating smoke and not letting it bubble up

in the colors object(name change?) make it so you can have properties abt each element type, so you can know things like
 if each element should have a solid fill or a rough one

make a list that has all the button ids so you can choose the order of em all

minecraft update?

ok i need to make plant drop water when it burns

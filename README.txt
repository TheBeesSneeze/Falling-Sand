Hi!

if youre struggling to figure out how to play the game don't worry, most people are.

just open the file "Falling Sand.html" 
if that doesnt work, make sure you're opening it with chrome (or your web browser of choice)

note: i haven't tested this game in any other web browser, theres no reason it *wouldnt* work outside of google, but its important you're at least aware of this if it doesn't work.
